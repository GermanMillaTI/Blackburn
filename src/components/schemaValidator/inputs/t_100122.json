It has to be on the new card that he is having right now. I can double-check with him again, and let you know if I still have any questions!\n\n\nThank you so much for your response I appreciate it!!!\nBest,",

If you don't mind replying to me, I still have some concerns about my dad's health benefits.\n\n\nIn the last email, you told me that he hadn't updated the HSA deduction, so it was canceled. He told me that for this [organization_name] health insurance, he gets an amount of [account_info] for [financial_data]. Is that true and what is it about? I just need clarification. I know that my dad did not understand English very well so that's why I always have to go back and forth like this with you, I'm so sorry about that. As my family still needs to pay some medical bills I just want to make sure about this problem again!\n\n\nI'm looking forward to hearing from you. Have a great day!\n\n\nBest,",
