Can you please confirm the following with a “yes” or “no”:\n\nDo you currently have a child that is 5 or younger and still enrolled in a Pre-K program?\nYou indicated in the survey that you have a child that disenrolled from a [organization_name] brand ([organization_name], [organization_name], [organization_name], T[organization_name], [organization_name], and/or [organization_name]), did you disenroll this child because you moved OR because they aged into Kindergarten?\n\n \n\nThank you!",
