Please log into Blackboard and respond to the short week one discussion. It should only take 15-20 minutes to introduce yourself and write two sentences regarding the short video or article. That is it; you are done for week one. No need to wait until Sunday. Feel free to let us know if you have any questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Meade and [personal_name]",
