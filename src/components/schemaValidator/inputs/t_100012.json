Please remember that the card on file must keep $125 on it at all times in case of incidental charges. If you agree, when would be the best time of day for a session?\n\n\nThank you,",

(which is when we last spoke) Usually when things like what you describe happen I immediately record the facts into the system so as not to rely solely upon my memory. I am sorry to hear that your mother was under the weather. (per my assistant)\n\n\nThese are the notes I put into the system:\nComments\nClient was a no show no call. Called the client and left a message 8 minutes into the appointment time.\n\n\nPart of the policy is that each client is to keep [financial_data] on their card at all times in the event of an emergency. We can meet half way and I can charge you half as a courtesy, but it is expected that all clients will keep [financial_data] plus [financial_data] for the credit card processing fee available at all times. Is this something you would be interested in?\n\n\nThanks,",
