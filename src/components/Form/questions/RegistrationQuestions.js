During your session onsite, you will be photographed and video-recorded while performing basic movements, which may include walking, sitting, standing up, different gestures, or facial expressions. You may be interacting with props and furniture.
                     The study will also collect photos, videos, and audios and measurements of individuals’ head, face, and hands in still and moving poses, under various lighting conditions. Finally, a specialist will make an impression of your outer ear. The tasks can be easily completed by anyone and do not require prior experience or special skills.</span></p>`

                            claims and defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient
                            method for resolving disputes.&nbsp; The arbitrator may hear motions and will apply the standards of the
                            Federal Rules of Civil Procedure governing such motions.&nbsp; Except as provided in the Class Action Waiver
                            and Representative Action Waiver, the arbitrator may award only remedies that would otherwise be available
                            in a court of law.&nbsp; The arbitrator’s decision or award will be in writing with findings of fact and

                            describes how they will use, share, or retain it, including whether they can disclose it to others. If we transmit Sensitive Category Data

                            about the identity of Customer on a separate page, and asked again whether you consent to your Special Category Data being transmitted to them. 
                            You may choose on this page, or at that time, not to proceed. If you choose not to proceed we will interpret that as a decision that you
