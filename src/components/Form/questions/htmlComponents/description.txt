        </br>
        <p><span><span style="font-weight: 400;">TELUS International is seeking participants for an onsite study just
                    south of Glendale. During your session onsite, you will be photographed and video-recorded while
                    performing basic movements, which may include walking, sitting, standing up, different gestures, or
                    facial expressions. You may be interacting with props and furniture.
                    The study will also collect photos, videos, and audios and measurements of individuals' head, face,
                    and hands in still and moving poses, under various lighting conditions. Finally, a specialist will
                    make an impression of your outer ear. The tasks can be easily completed by anyone and do not require
                    prior experience or special skills.</span></p>
        <p>Payments will be made via Hyperwallet, where you can choose PayPal, bank transfer, or Venmo as the payment
            method.</p>
